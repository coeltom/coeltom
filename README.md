# üí´ About Me:
As a web development enthusiast, I have pursued my passion for technology and programming by obtaining a Fontend web developer degree from Coderhouse. There, I learned and applied various skills and tools, such as Figma, GitHub, and Bootstrap, to design and develop user-friendly websites. I have also gained valuable experience as a Freelance Web Developer, working on projects for different clients and companies, such as Sweet&Fresh, a Mexican Import/Export business.<br><br>Additionally, I had the opportunity to work as an Account Manager at Hilti Italia, a leading provider of construction solutions, for three months, where I supported the sales and service team and managed customer relations. My goal is to deepen my knowledge and expertise in web development by joining a professional team that values innovation, collaboration, and quality.<br><br>Let's connect and build something amazing together!
